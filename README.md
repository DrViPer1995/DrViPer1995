- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrViPer1995. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Quantum computing, more especially in Quantum Machine Learning, Combinatorial Optimization with Quantum Annealing and Quantum-Inspired approaches such as Tensor Networks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensor Networks techniques for Machine Learning. Namely, I am focusing on Tensor Networks Born Machines for Generator Enhanced Optimization (TN-GEO).
- 💞️ I’m currently looking to implement TN-GEO with python, following Javier Alcazar et al. in GEO: Enhancing Combinatorial Optimization with Classical and Quantum Generative Models.
- There is plenty library dedicated to Tensor Networks in python. I would need some advices on which one to choose for this project.
- 📫 If you have some advices or suggestions for this project please send me an e-mail at vivien.perrin@qbit-soft.com.
